# nc-eTAG
Welcome to the nc-eTAG file and metadata specification project space.
nc-eTAG is a netCDF file, metadata &amp; data Interoperability standard for (non-acoustic) electronic tagging datasets (nc-eTAG).
It leverages and extends prevailing OGC and Earth Science data Interoperability standards based on the netCDF scientific, self-describing
file format, the Climate Forecast (CF) and ACDD (Attribute Conventions on Data Discovery) and associated NOAA/NCEI oceanographic in-situ
data implementation of these. It includes format specification documentation and associated netCDF Common Data Language (CDL) templates applicable to key classes 
of electronic tagging data representative of products from a range of instrument manufacturers.  The templates specifications provide
a technical roadmap for implementation of standards compliant, archive quality data files by data providers and tag manufacturers alike..
